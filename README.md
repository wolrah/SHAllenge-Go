I was sufficiently bored when I saw [SHAllenge](https://shallenge.quirino.net/) hit the HN frontpage that I decided to try to write a "miner" for it, and since I heard Go is good about concurrency I figured it'd be a good opportunity to learn something.

Expect nothing quality here, this code is full of naive design.  Lots of things are hardcoded that shouldn't be, stuff gets tested by commenting parts out, and a human has to look at the output to decide of something interesting happened.
